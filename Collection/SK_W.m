function [SK,M4,M2,f] = SK_W(x,Nfft,Noverlap,Window)
% [SK,M4,M2,f] = SK_W(x,Nfft,Noverlap,Window) 
% Welch's estimate of the spectral kurtosis       
%       SK(f) = M4(f)/M2(f)^2 - 2 
% where M4(f) = E{|X(f)|^4} and M2(f) = E{|X(f)|^2} are the fourth and
% second order moment spectra of signal x, respectively.
% Signal x is divided into overlapping blocks (Noverlap taps), each of which is
% detrended, windowed and zero-padded to length Nfft. Input arguments nfft, Noverlap, and Window
% are as in function 'PSD' or 'PWELCH' of Matlab. Denoting by Nwind the window length, it is recommended to use 
% nfft = 2*NWind and Noverlap = 3/4*Nwind with a hanning window.
% (note that, in the definition of the spectral kurtosis, 2 is subtracted instead of 3 because Fourier coefficients
% are complex circular)
